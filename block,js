# Blockchain Project - First code set.
# index: A unique number tracking the position of every block in the entire blockchain.
# timestamp: Records the time of occurrence of each completed transaction.
# data: Data shown in reference to the completed transactions, such as sender details, recipient’s details, and quantity transacted.
# blockHash: Points to preceding block in the blockchain, which is important in maintaining the blockchain’s integrity.
# The computeHash method is to calculate the hash of the block based on its properties, given in the data below.
